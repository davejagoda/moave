# moave

## Deprecated

I do not recommend this approach any more, and have only left this is
in place for historical purposes and for any legacy code that might
still use it.

Here is a better approach.

Substite REPO with the actual repository name.

```
cd ~src/github
git clone git@github.com:davejagoda/REPO.git
cd REPO
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Mother of All Virtual Environments

This is the Virtual Env that has the Python modules I use
commonly. Instead of having a Virtual Env for each project, I find
that most can just use this one.

#### Instructions

```
mkdir ~/Envs
cd ~/Envs
sudo pip install virtualenv
virtualenv moave
cd moave
source bin/activate
pip install -r ~/src/github/moave/requirements.txt
```

###### *Nota bene*

My Virtual Env use case is to easily configure non-core Python
libraries without modifying the site packages and without needing to
be root. I am not trying to solve the 'project X needs version N of
library L' problem (since I haven't faced it yet with Python).
