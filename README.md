## Mother of All Virtual Environments

This is the Virtual Env that has the Python modules I use
commonly. Instead of having a Virtual Env for each project, I find
that most can just use this one.

###### *Nota bene*

My Virtual Env use case is to easily configure non-core Python
libraries without modifying the site packages and without needing to
be root. I am not trying to solve the 'project X needs version N of
library L' problem (since I haven't faced it yet with Python).
